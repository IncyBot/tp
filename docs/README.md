# NUSFC 24

NUSFC 24 is an association football-themed game app. Unlike the more famous games like EA Sports FC 24 and eFootball,
NUSFC 24 is played via a Command Line Interface (CLI). The game does not simulate the main game of a football match.
Rather, it simulates penalty shoot-out for football.
